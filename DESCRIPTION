Description: Provides two functions. One will convert a Markdown file to a Mindmap file,
    based on the number of pound signs before each codeblock, and inserts in the codeblock
    as notes and any input and output as extra nodes. The other function will convert Mindmap files
    into Markdown files, following the same pattern as the first function.
